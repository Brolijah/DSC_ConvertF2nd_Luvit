# DSC_ConvertF2nd_Luvit
This is a work in progress Lua script for converting Project DIVA F 1 DSCs to F 2nd DSCs.  
It requires Luvit to run it.  
This is just a first revision, so I'll trade up to C or C# down the road...  

### How To Use
Be sure you have Luvit installed and somewhere in your PATH.  
Place DSC files from F 1 into the F1 in folder.  
From a command prompt, enter:  
```
luvit f1_to_f2nd_CHART_dsc.lua
```  
And that's it... I have way more comments inside the actual Lua script so if you want to read more, look inside.  
[Update] As a side project I've yet to post to github, I'm working on a DSC library in C# that I would like to be compatible with each of the DIVA games without much struggle to implement other DSC formats. My priority is F 2nd, but I have some friends who put efforts into the other games more. I don't have much I can say on it for now, but I'll put it up when it's in a usable state.
