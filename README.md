# DSC_ConvertF2nd_Luvit
This is a work in progress Lua script for converting Project DIVA F 1 DSCs to F 2nd DSCs.
It requires Luvit to run it.
This is just a first revision, so I'll trade up to C or C# down the road...

### How To Use
Be sure you have Luvit installed and somewhere in your PATH.
Place DSC files from F 1 into the F1 in folder.
From a command prompt, enter:
```
luvit f1_to_f2nd_CHART_dsc.lua
```
And that's it... I have way more comments inside the actual Lua script so if you want to read more, look inside.
